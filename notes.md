Data reporting is inconsistent:

1. Sometimes a tax bill is missing entirely for a quarter.
2. Sometimes the registration count simply disappears
3. Sometimes older buildings start reporting units when they hadn't before,
   despite not collecting abatements (1/01248/0048/)

Some ideas on smoothing out such numbers:

1. Whenever a tax bill is missing, simply use the previous year's number
2. If a property is still collecting SCRIE/DRIE but has no apts in the program,
   use the previous year (or next, if they start reporting later on but were
   collecting SCRIE/DRIE before.)
3. Backfill older buildings if they start reporting units but don't start
   reporting any new abatements
