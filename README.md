- Python 2.6 or greater (not tested on 3)
- `virtualenv` or `virtualenvwrapper` (in order to install requirements without
  using `sudo`

## Usage

### To download all documents for a single address:

    python download.py <house no> '<street name with suffix>' <borough number>

Make sure to put the street name in single quotes.

### To download documents for multiple addresses:

1. Create a tab separated file (eg: `addresses.tsv`) containing the house
   number, street name and suffix, and borough number. Separate each address by
   a new line.

2. Then do:

       python download.py addresses.tsv

## Sample

You can see a sample of data being collected [here](http://104.236.234.7/).

These are raw records being pulled from all buildings with ten or more units in
CB 8 (Upper East Side) in Manhattan, CBs 8 & 9 in Brooklyn (Lefferts/Crown
Heights), CB4 in the Bronx (Concourse), CBs 1 & 2 in Queens (Astoria & LIC),
and CB1 in Staten Island (North Shore.)

Folder scheme: Data - > borough (1,2,3,4 or 5) -> block -> bbl

## scraper

scraper.js scrapes property tax bill and ouputs a json:
   {
      activityThrough: null,
      ownerName: '',
      propertyAddress: '',
      bbl: '',
      mailingAddress: '',
      rentStabilized: null,
      units: null,
      annualPropertyTax: null,
      abatements: [],
      billableAssessedValue: null,
      taxRate: null
    }

scrape (filepath, callback)

filepath is the filepath to the tax bill
callback is call with one argument contain the taxDoc object;

## issues

  * The annualPropertyTax field for November 2012 and 2013's bills scrapes incorrectly
  * There are issues when rent-stabilized units appear more than once such as in 1-01505-0044

## download.js

  reads a file with a bbl on each line. bbl has to be in 10 digit format (such as 1015050044). It then downloads all the property tax bills and notice of property tax bills, once at a time.

  You can change the number of concurrent download at the risk of overwhelming the sever.
